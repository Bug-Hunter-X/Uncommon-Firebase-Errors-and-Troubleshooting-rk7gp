The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the app is not properly initialized or if there's a problem connecting to the Firebase backend.  This can manifest in various ways, depending on the specific Firebase service and how your app interacts with it.  For example, a common scenario is when attempting to access data from the Realtime Database or Firestore before the app is fully authenticated or connected to Firebase. Another less common scenario is an asynchronous operation within a Firebase function that might not be properly handled, leading to race conditions or unexpected behaviour. Sometimes the issue might stem from incorrect configuration of the Firebase project or the app itself, where the provided credentials might be wrong or missing required settings.
