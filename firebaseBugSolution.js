To address asynchronous issues, always ensure proper error handling with `.catch()` blocks for asynchronous Firebase operations.  For instance, when reading data from Firestore, always use `.get().then().catch()` to handle potential errors during the retrieval.  For initialization problems, verify that the Firebase app is correctly initialized before any interaction with Firebase services, checking for null or undefined values appropriately.  Implement proper loading states to provide feedback to the user during asynchronous operations to enhance user experience. Ensure your Firebase project configuration is accurate and all required settings are correctly implemented. Always check your Firebase console for any errors or warnings that might provide more clues about the problem.
